# ccRNA_miSeq

Repository for analyzing a multiplexed PCR with template-switching, followed by Gibson circularization and miSeq, to identify ccRNA.

Original effort included SNP-containing templates, but their abundance was too low to reliably use to correct for incorrect template-switching.

We instead assess chimera rate, whcih was ~<0.05%, and so unlikely to explain our observations.
